About Me

I am passionate in web development and design. No matter if it's a website or an application, I strive to provide an intuitive and fluid user experience.

I graduated from the University of Bath with a master's degree in Mechanical Engineer. Having worked as an engineer in the robotics field, I discovered my interest in computer science and programming. I enjoy using my technical and analytical skills to solve challenges.

Technologies I use daily:

-Javascript ES6+
-React
-Typescript
-HTML & CSS
-Git
